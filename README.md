Online Retail Data Analysis
This project analyzes an online retail dataset with the aim of understanding customer purchasing behavior and developing a predictive model for future purchases.

Libraries Used
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
* Scikit-learn: For clustering (K-Means) and predictive modeling
* XGBoost: For future predictive modeling (installation included)
* Analysis Overview

Data Cleaning
* Loaded data from Online Retail.xlsx.
* Dropped rows with missing CustomerID and Description, and removed duplicates.
* Result: Cleaned dataset with 401,604 entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Generated descriptive statistics for key numerical columns.
* Identified top 10 most sold products.
* Visualized monthly sales trends over time.

Feature Engineering:
* Created new features like TotalPurchase, DayOfWeek, and Hour from InvoiceDate.

Customer Segmentation:
* Used K-Means clustering to segment customers based on total purchase behavior.
* Visualized customer clusters.

Predictive Modeling:
* Created a binary target variable (PurchaseMade).
* Used selected features to predict purchases and split data into training and testing sets.

Next Steps
* Further predictive modeling using XGBoost.
